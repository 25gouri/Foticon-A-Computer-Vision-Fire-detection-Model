# Foticon-A-Computer-Vision-Fire-detection-Model
Foticon is a Computer Vision Project used to detect fire using Image Processing Techniques in Python

THE PROBLEM: 
 
In the current scenario, fire outbreak is common issue happening these days all over the world and the damage caused by this type of incidents is tremendous toward nature and causing loss to the human life. As per the research report given by Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India (ADSI), it was stated as fire-related accidents have killed 35 people every day on an average in the last six years between 2016 and 2021. To overcome this issue, we have come up with a safe and cost effective model. Though there are existing technologies for the fire detection, our proposed system can be deployed easily in the existing cameras like CCTV which makes it portable and reliable. As there are no hardware components involved in this model, hence it is cost-effective and will be much efficient in nature.

THE TEAMS APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM :-
 
In this we are using image processing techniques which is compatible in surveillance devices like CCTV, wireless camera to UAVs. It can be mostly used in Railway stations, crowded places like markets, bus stations, since the cameras are already installed in such places and this system is aimed at diminishing the disadvantages of false alarm which makes the system cost effective, efficient and a fast method for detecting fire. Coming to the working model, whenever the fire is detected it sends a message to nearby fire stations and to the concerned departments with a beep or alarm sound at the place where the fire outbreak has occurred.
 
TITLE OF THE PROJECT:-FOTICON

What inspired you to select the problem? 
 
In recent times, Fire accidents are major disasters. Fire accidents cause a major damage to human life.To decrease the damage caused due to fire accidents we come up with the Image processing Technology. This project can be implemented in any crowded places.

What do you feel is the most innovative part of the problem? 

As there are more fire accidents taking place and no technology is getting closer to detect fire. So we  came up with an idea to detect fire more simply by using cc camera’s.

LIBRARIES USED: 

NumPy:
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. Numpy provides the powerful data structure known as n-d array and function to manipulate that n-d array .This data structure is used by other library to represent complex data such as images.

Open CV is a cross-platform library using which we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection.

Features of OpenCV Library
Using OpenCV library, you can – 
Read and write images, Capture and save videos, Process images (filter, transform), Perform feature detection, Detect specific objects such as faces, eyes, cars, in the videos or images.
Analyze the video, i.e., estimate the motion in it, subtract the background, and track objects in it.

OpenCV Library Modules

Following are the main library modules of the OpenCV library.

Core Functionality : 
This module covers the basic data structures such as Scalar, Point, Range, etc., that are used to build OpenCV applications. In addition to these, it also includes the multidimensional array Mat, which is used to store the images. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name org.opencv.core.

Image Processing : 
This module covers various image processing operations such as image filtering, geometrical image transformations, color space conversion, histograms, etc. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name org.opencv.imgproc.

Video : 
This module covers the video analysis concepts such as motion estimation, background subtraction, and object tracking. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name org.opencv.video.

Video I/O : 
This module explains the video capturing and video codecs using OpenCV library. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name org.opencv.videoio.

calib3d : 
This module includes algorithms regarding basic multiple-view geometry algorithms, single and stereo camera calibration, object pose estimation, stereo correspondence and elements of 3D reconstruction. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name org.opencv.calib3d.

features2d : 
This module includes the concepts of feature detection and description. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name org.opencv.features2d.

Objdetect
This module includes the detection of objects and instances of the predefined classes such as faces, eyes, mugs, people, cars, etc. In the Java library of OpenCV, this module is included as a package with the name org.opencv.objdetect.

Highgui : 
This is an easy-to-use interface with simple UI capabilities. In the Java library of OpenCV, the features of this module is included in two different package namely, org.opencv.imgcodecs and org.opencv.videoio.

HSV: 
The HSV or Hue, Saturation and Value of a given object is the color space associated with the object in OpenCV where Hue represents the color, Saturation represents the greyness and Value represents the brightness and it is used to solve the problems related to computer vision because of its better performance when compared to RGB or Red, Blue and Green color space and the Hue range in HSV is [0,179], the Saturation range in HSV is [0,255] and the Value range in HSV is [0,255] and to perform object detection, finding the range of HSV is necessary.

Jupyter Notebook:
Jupyter is significantly slower than python, whether or not many print statements are used. Nearly all functions suffer decreased performance, but especially if you are analyzing large dataframes or performing complex calculations, I would stick with Ipython. Jupyter Notebook online compiler, IDE, and collaborative coding environment. Code, run, share, and collaborate on Jupyter Notebook.

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS: 
We can develop this project in more modern way by using different paths. We can redevelop this project by using temperature sensors and capturing the exact position of fire and in many ways. There is much more way to develop this and make this more useful in the future

CONCLUSION: 
This project will be more helpful in public areas because in this busy world everyone is scheduled in their own work and not caring about the surrounding until there is effect. This problem can be with help of our project regarding fire problems
